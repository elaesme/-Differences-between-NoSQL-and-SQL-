# -Differences-between-NoSQL-and-SQL-

In this project, the same data from the ‘Analyzing ATPTennis Data with SQL on MySQL’ project was used. After understanding the major differences
between NoSQL and SQL, old queries from the old project rewritten in NoSQL and additionally
new queries that are more optimal for NoSQL were created. For this project, MongoDB was
used.
